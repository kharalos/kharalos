Hello there!
My name is Ömer. I am a Casual/Hyper Casual Game Developer. I mainly use Unity, in addition to this I have practical knowledge of Three.js. I am currently mass-producing Hyper Casual games solely. My fundamental motivation is to establish my own company specializing in games. Or gather enough experience so that I can work as a senior developer at an ambitious company.

You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ömer-ünal-4972341b1/.

Have a pleasant day.
