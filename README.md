# Hello there! [<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u7NwlxyHL.png" alt="drawing" width="100"/>](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-there)

My name is Ömer. I am a Casual/Hyper Casual Game Developer. 

I mainly use [<img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-brands-5/24/unity-512.png" alt="drawing" width="50"/>](https://play.unity.com/u/Kharalos)Unity, in addition to this I have practical knowledge of [<img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/threejs/original/2X/e/e4f86d2200d2d35c30f7b1494e96b9595ebc2751.png" alt="drawing" width="50"/>](http://pkhood.com)Three.js. 

Currently mass-producing Hyper Casual games solely. My fundamental motivation is to kickstart a company specializing in games. Or gather enough experience to work as a senior developer for an ambitious company.

I have a passion of using [<img src="https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/dakirby309/simply-styled/256/Blender-icon.png" alt="drawing" width="50"/>](https://www.blender.org)Blender to produce assets to my game, you can check some of them at [<img src="https://static.sketchfab.com/static/builds/web/dist/static/assets/images/favicon/a81e1fd93fc053fed8a5f56640f886f8-v2.png" alt="drawing" width="50"/>](https://sketchfab.com/kharalos)

Have a pleasant day.
